=============

Each of these scripts performs a single task independently, they are not part of any 
specific workflow.

Detect torus
------------

This script is run in SpaceClaim and doesn't require any input from the user.
It highlights all the bodies (in opaque yellow) that contain a toroidal surface (in 
opaque red). All the other bodies are made blue transparent. If no toroidal surface is 
found, a message window will pop up and no color modifications will be made.

FMESH tally generator
---------------------

This script is run in SpaceClaim, drag and drop the file and run it by clicking on the 
green arrow button after selecting a body and run the script to get its related MCNP FMESH and TR cards.
The body should be a prism: 6 reactangular and orthogonal faces.

.. tip::

    The F4Enix package includes a function to automatically generate a compatible CSV
    file from an MCNP output file: `link <https://f4enix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/f4enix.output.MCNPoutput.Output.html#f4enix.output.MCNPoutput.Output.print_lp_debug>`_.

Simplify toroidal profiles
--------------------------

This script is run in SpaceClaim.
Enter into section mode and select the whole section of a body with toroidal profiles.
The curves will be substituted by straight lines with a given angle between them.
Then the new profile can be extruded to create a new body composed only of conical and
cylindrical surfaces.
